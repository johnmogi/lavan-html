# cryptocoin.io

The top 3 errors to correct:

1. no graphs draw with data ( split into data retrieve and data build)
2. the toggle in the modal and after return
3. review order of functions and natural flow/ optimization.

4. maybe build a sample supported view for those coins that do exist in the compare api?
