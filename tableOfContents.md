Hi there,

Wellcome to Coin.io the second John Bryce project made by John Mogi.

The following file will hopefully help to clea the file folders and Js files order.

I did use ajax.JQXR for pages transition, it seemed to me better at the organisation level. hopefully this won't affect the way this get loaded on external devices- a depricated "``" - Backtick version could be found here:

all in all I hope ...

Cheers, John
